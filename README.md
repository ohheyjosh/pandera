# Pandera

Pandera is a fun little package that lets you replace the word "pandemic" with a randomly selected, similar sounding word (I think we can all agree we're collectively pandemic fatigued ðŸ™ƒ).

## Usage

This package can be installed using either `npm` or `yarn`.

### Use In Your Console

Install by running `npm install --global pandera` or `yarn global add pandera` in your terminal.

You can now call it anywhere by typing `pandera` in your terminal to get a random p-word.

### Importing into your project

Install by running `npm install -d pandera` or `yarn add --dev pandera` in your project directory.

After adding the package to your project, you can import the `'pandera'` package to use it:

```js
const pandera = require('pandera');
```

After importing the package, calling the `pandera()` function will return a random p-word.
